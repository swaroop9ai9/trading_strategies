# Abstract Statement [Disprove Arbitrage Pircing Theory]
Tried to disprove Arbitrage Pricing Theory by using three long existing stocks such as Intel,Microsoft and Apple. I have used three macro economic factors Gross Domestic Product, Inflation rate, Oil price return.

# Result and Conclusion

* The result shows the association between excess return of Apple and pre-defined macroeconomic variables.  Accordingly, the estimated coefficient of the model is not statistically significant indicating that these macroeconomic variables do not account for the excess return of Apple. More specifically,  by looking at p-values, I conclude that the estimated coefficients of  inflation growth, and oil return is not statistically significant at conventional levels. But GDP is having a part in prediction of AAPL stock Price To be interpret, one unit increase in gdp growth boosts excess return in apple by nearly 11.4 times. This model presents the nexus between excess return of Intel and the same macroecomic variables provided below.

* Differently from the Apple case, this analysis confirms that there is a statistically significant relationship between excess return of Intel and gdp growth of US at 10% level (p-value is 0.093). To be interpret, one unit increase in gdp growth boosts
 excess return on Intel by nearly 8.96. So, there is a positive relationship between gdp growth and excess return of Intel. However, no relation is detected for the rest of the variables.
 
* Microsoft is not having not much of influence on Stock price by macro economic factors.
